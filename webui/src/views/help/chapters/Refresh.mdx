# <RefreshIcon className="icon"/> Discovery/Refresh

If you don't see any communication information yet, manually refresh the display
using the &#32;<RefreshIcon className="icon"/> button in the application bar. Do
not use your browser's refresh button.

Rest assured, this just starts the app-internal new discovery process and does
not reload the web application itself. As soon as the discovery data becomes
available, <Brand/>'s display will updated automatically. A circling throbber
will appear around the &#32;<RefreshIcon className="icon"/> refresh button
whenever discovery takes more time to notify you of an ongoing discovery.

After discovery, first time users will automatically be shown the [wiring
view](wiring): the virtual IP stacks found of containers, et cetera, with their
virtual wiring connecting them to the host, to other containers, and so on.

## Automatic Refresh Interval

Alternatively, if you hate clicking refresh buttons, you can also set an
automatic refresh interval using the &#32;<span style={{whiteSpace:
'nowrap'}}><SyncIcon className="icon"/><ExpandMoreIcon className="icon"/></span>
menu. However, please bear in mind that discoveries are putting some load on
your host, so please opt for slower refresh intervals.

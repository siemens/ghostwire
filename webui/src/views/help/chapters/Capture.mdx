# <CaptureIcon className="icon"/> Live Capture

"Live capture" *streams* your captured network packets directly from the system
you are looking at to a [Wireshark™](https://wireshark.org) network protocol
analyzer on your desktop system. "Downloading" was before, 'tis now the
*streaming* age. Live captures allow you to see network packets in "real time"
(albeit with some delay due to transmitting them from the capture host to your
desktop Wireshark).

No more first having to do start and later stop some "blind" capturing and
downloading a capture file afterwards – just to find out that you got it wrong,
so you need to rinse and repeat, hoping it'll work this time.

To start live captures, simply click on one of the <CaptureIcon
className="icon"/> capture buttons.

> **Important:** if you have restarted a container you want to capture from in
  the meantime since last refreshing <Brand/>'s display, you must
  &#32;<RefreshIcon className="icon"/> refresh before you capture. Otherwise the
  capture might fail as the container's virtual IP stack got a different
  identifier due to the container restart.

Depending on which capture button you click on, the context of captured network
traffic differs as follows: 

| Element | Capture Context |
| --- | --- |
| <span style={{whiteSpace: "nowrap"}}><ContaineeBadge containee={containerBox} /><TargetCapture demo target={containerBox.netns} /></span> | captures from *all* network interfaces of the (virtual) IP stack used by the container, pod, et cetera. |
| <span style={{whiteSpace: "nowrap"}}><ContaineeBadge containee={pod} /><TargetCapture demo target={containerBox.netns} /></span> | captures from all containers of this particular pod – *please see note below*. |
| <span style={{whiteSpace: "nowrap"}}><NifBadge nif={veth1Nif} /><TargetCapture demo target={veth1Nif} /></span> | captures only from this particular network interface. |

## Notes

#### Live Capture Wireshark Plugin and Service

To use live packet capture you'll need:

- both the [ClusterShark external capture
  plugin](https://github.com/siemens/cshargextcap) as well as a **Wireshark™
  version 3.0.2** or later installed on your client system (Windows only at the
  moment).

- on the server side you'll need the [Packetflix live capture streaming
  service](https://github.com/siemens/edgeshark) which simultaneously acts as
  the combined service access point for Ghostwire. On an Industrial Edge simply
  install the "Edgeshark" app via your Industrial Edge Management service.

#### Capturing From All Network Interfaces

Live packet capture streams include information about the network interface a
particular packet was received on or transmitted from. This ensures a clear and
unambiguous picture as to *where exactly* a packet came in or went out.

Due to technical restrictions of the (OpenSource)
[dumpcap](https://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/dumpcap.html) capture tool
used as the ultimate source of packet capture streams, <Brand/> **must specify
the exact list of (operational) network interfaces to capture from at the time
the capturing starts**.

> If at any time later a new network interface gets added or an existing
  non-operational network interface becomes operational then such network
  interfaces will get ignored in the running capture stream.

#### Many Containers, Same IP Stack

When multiple containers share the same IP stack, it is **not possible to
capture the traffic of a single container only**. This is due to the technical
design of Linux containers and network namespaces. Please use capture filters to
capture only traffic to or from a specific container. The transport ports table
can help with identifying interesting traffic.

# Containees

In short, "containees" is our general term for lumping together *pods*,
*containers*, *stand-alone processes*, and process-less *"bind-mounted"* network
namespaces.

A core principle of Linux network namespaces (as well as any Linux namespace in
general) is that they cannot simply exist out of their own will. Instead, they
need processes attached to them, where these processes can be either outside or
inside "containers" (managed by a container engine, such as Docker).
Additionally, namespaces can also be "anchored" to the file system without any
process (currently) attached to them. But without a process or a file system
anchor, network namespaces will simply vanish -- and even our <Brand/> won't be
able to detect any trace of them anymore.

| Containee | Description |
| --- | --- |
| <ContaineeBadge containee={standaloneBox} /> | a **"stand-alone" process** (not part of any container); clicking on it navigates to a detailed view of the network namespace this process is currently attached to. |
| <ContaineeBadge containee={containerBox} /> | a (named) **container**. The colored bar at the left edge signals the container state, with green indicating a running container, yellow signalling a paused container, and red showing an exited container (not to be confused with "Norwegian Blue"). Again, clicking on this container badge navigates to a detailed view of the network namespace this process is currently attached to. |
| <ContaineeBadge containee={priv} /> | a **privileged Docker container**. Deploying containers as "privileged" should be avoided if possible and such containers instead be deployed with only the precise capabilities and security options necessary, instead of the heavy-handed "privileged" setting. |
| <ContaineeBadge containee={elev} /> | a container with Linux capabilities other than or in addition to [Docker's default capabilities for containers](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#runtime-privilege-and-linux-capabilities). |
| <ContaineeBadge containee={pod} /> | a **pod** is a group of containers sharing the same virtual IP stack. Clicking on a pod badge navigates to a detailed view of the network namespace associated with this particular pod. |
| <ContaineeBadge containee={debugme} /> | a **debuggable Industrial Edge App**. This information is shown only for IE runtimes of version 1.8 or later. |
| <ContaineeBadge containee={boundBox} /> | a **process-less network namespace** that has been bound to a file system path in order to prevent the namespace from getting garbage collected. Such "bind-mounted" namespaces can serve both more permanent tasks in some segmented network setups, as well as temporarily appear while a container engine is configuring the networking of a new container and the container's initial process hasn't even started yet. As usual, clicking on this box navigates to a detailed view of the bind-mounted network namespace. |

> **Note:** multiple containees can share the same virtual IP stack (network
  namespace).

## Container Types

And now more specifically to the different types of containers that <Brand/>
differentiates:

| Symbol | Type of Container |
| --- | --- |
| <Docker/> | [Docker](https://docker.com)/[Moby](https://https://mobyproject.org/) |
| <DockerPlugin/> | Docker managed plugin |
| <CRI/> | CRI (Kubernetes Container Runtime Interface) |
| <Podman/> | [podman](https://podman.io) |
| <IERuntime/> | Siemens Industrial Edge runtime |
| <Container/> | unknown container type |

## Container Groups

Some containers may be "grouped"; <Brand/> then shows different symbols
depending on the type of container group, together with the group name.

| Symbol | Type of Container Group |
| --- | --- |
| <ComposerProject/> | (Docker) [compose](https://compose-spec.io/) project |
| <IEApp/> | Siemens Industrial Edge App |
| <K8sPod/> | Kubernetes Pod |

> **Note:** <Brand/> supports only the Docker-compatible functionality of
> podman. Podman pods are neither discovered nor shown as such â€“ instead, their
> individual containers (including the infrastructure/sandbox container) are
> shown only.

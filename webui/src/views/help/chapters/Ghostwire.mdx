# <Brand/>

In a nutshell: **<Brand/>** lets you easily see and explore how the virtual
network configuration inside your Linux host is set up...

<p />

- the (virtual) IP network stacks,

- how these IP stacks are connected to each other and the outside world,

- how these IP stacks relate to the containers, pods, or stand-alone processes
  which are using them,

- IP address and routing configuration (IPv4 and IPv6),

- DNS configuration of containers,

- listening and connected TCP and UDP ports,

- TCP and UDP port forwarding including the serving containers and processes;
  and this not only for the host itself, but also in all containers.

- easily create screenshots of the wiring for documentation and trouble
  shooting, using the screenshot <ScreenshotIcon className="icon"/> button in
  the application bar and nipping all the well-known hassle with corporate
  browser plugin policies in the bud.

<p />

Where available, [live packet captures](capture) into
[Wiresharkâ„¢](https://wireshark.org) can be started directly from this web user
interface with just a single click.

The discovery engine supports several container engines/runtimes, even putting
one container engine _into_ another one. Please see also [Technical
Features](tech) for more details.

## Explore

In a nutshell: **<Brand/>** lets you easily see and explore how the virtual
network configuration inside your Linux host (including
[WSL2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux)) is set up...

<p />

- the (virtual) IP network stacks,

- how these IP stacks are connected to each other and the outside world,

- how these IP stacks relate to the containers, pods, or stand-alone processes
  which are using them,

- IP address and routing configuration (IPv4 and IPv6),

- DNS configuration of containers,

- listening and connected TCP and UDP ports,

- TCP and UDP port forwarding including the serving containers and processes;
  and this not only for the host itself, but also in all containers,

- filter the displayed IP stacks by container names, et cetera,

- easily create screenshots of the wiring for documentation and trouble
  shooting, using the screenshot <ScreenshotIcon className="icon"/> button in
  the application bar and nipping all the well-known hassle with corporate
  browser plugin policies in the bud.

<p />

The discovery engine supports _multiple_ container engines/runtimes, even
putting one container engine _into_ another one. Two prominent examples are
[Kubernetes in Docker](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind) and [Docker
Desktop on Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/).
Please see also [Technical Features](tech) for more details.

## Live Capture

Where available, [live packet captures](capture) into
[Wiresharkâ„¢](https://wireshark.org) can be started directly from this web user
interface with just a single click. For this, you'll need to have Wireshark and
our Wireshark [cshargextcap
plugin](https://github.com/siemens/cshargextcap/releases) installed. You can
install this plugin at any time without the need to restart your browser
(Chrome/Chromium, ...).

- capture from all network interfaces of a container/containee,
- capture from a single specific network interface,
- capture from multiple, selected network interfaces of the same
  container/containee.

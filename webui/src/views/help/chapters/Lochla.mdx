# <NetnsViewIcon className="icon"/> Open and Forwarded Host Ports View

This view shows a table with the discovered open ports and forwarded ports of
the host that are accept traffic. It is basically a combination and
simplification of the "port forwarding" and "transport" tables, specifically for
the host itself.

This table is designed to give users a quick overview on what kind of traffic
the host will accept. It does **not** show established connections. Please
switch into the [detail view](details) for the host itself in order to also see
established connections to host processes. For established connections to
container services, please switch to the detail view of a particular container.

# IP Stacks Galore!

So, what's the meaning of the number badge hovering above our <Brand/> mascot in
the application bar that appears after pressing the &#32;<RefreshIcon
className="icon"/> button?

It shows the _number_ of discovered "virtual IP network stacks" (including the
host's own IP stack). This badge will only appear after discovery data has
successfully been received from the <Brand/> discovery service. For instance:

<FakeAppBar>
  <b><Brand/></b>{" "}
  <MuiBadge badgeContent="42" color="secondary">
    <BrandIcon size="default" style={{ verticalAlign: "middle" }} />
  </MuiBadge>
</FakeAppBar>

In case some IP stacks have been filtered from display (see
[settings](settings)), this is indicated by a "+" after the number of IP stacks
shown. With the default settings this can be the case when a host contains
"isolated" network namespaces without any connections other than their own
isolated loopback ("lo") network interface. Typical examples of applications
creating isolated "sandbox" IP stacks are *Chrome*, *Firefox*, *haveged* (for
generating random numbers and feeding the Linux random device), as well as
others.

<FakeAppBar>
  <b><Brand/></b>{" "}
  <MuiBadge badgeContent="42+" color="secondary">
    <BrandIcon size="default" style={{ verticalAlign: "middle" }} />
  </MuiBadge>
</FakeAppBar>

## Background: Virtual IP Stacks / Network Namespaces

What we slightly sloppily call "virtual IP network stacks" are actually a highly
useful Linux technology termed ["network
namespaces"](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/network_namespaces.7.html).
Despite the terminology and in a twist of irony, these Linux "namespaces" do
_not_ have names. Historically, the first type of namespace in Linux was the
"mount" namespace and thus is also about file system paths ... and this is where
the meaning of "namespace" actually originates from.

Thus, <Brand/> tries its best to give network namespaces useful names, for
instance, taken from the names of containers or processes that are using these
network namespaces. This enhances your user experience and makes diagnosing
virtual communication so much easier: "morbid_moby" instead of a non-permanent
inode number, such as "4026531905".

Throughout <Brand/>, we use the term ["containees"](containees) whenever
we are referring to containers, standalone processes, or even so-called
"bind-mounted" network namespaces (without any process, not least any whacky
container).

## Background: Containers â‰  Namespaces

While containers make use of Linux network namespaces, containers and namespaces
are two completely separate technologies. _Containers_ are a user-space "lie" in
that they don't exist at all at the level of the Linux kernel. But containers
combine several "first class" kernel-space elements to make their lie more
convincing, not least _network namespaces_.

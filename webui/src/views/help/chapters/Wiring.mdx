# <WiringViewIcon className="icon"/> Wiring View

> &#32;<BookmarkBorderIcon className="icon"/> **Pro Tip:** you can bookmark all
  views in your browser, especially when "zooming in" on a particular container
  or process.

> **Pro Tip:** you can easily create a complete screenshot of the wiring by
  simply clicking on the screenshot <ScreenshotIcon className="icon"/> button in
  the application bar. This allows downloading the wiring screenshot in PNG
  image format, in user-selectable image density. Please note that the
  screenshot button <ScreenshotIcon className="icon"/> only appears after the
  wiring has been discovered successfully for the first time.

The wiring view shows the discovered (virtual) IP stacks, as well as the
"virtual wiring" between the network interfaces of these IP stacks. For each IP
stack (network namespace), <Brand/> also shows the ["containees"](containees)
(pods, containers, stand-alone processes, et cetera) using that particular IP
stack. For example:

<Box m={2} style={{width: '25em'}}>
  <Breadboard netns={[initNetns, morbidNetns]}>
    <NetnsPlainCard netns={initNetns} />
    <Box m={1}/>
    <NetnsPlainCard netns={morbidNetns} />
  </Breadboard>
</Box>

##### Zoom Into IP Stack Details

**Click on a container or process** <ContaineeBadge containee={containerBox}
endIcon={<FullscreenIcon/>}/> in order to navigate to a detail view showing
detailed communication information about the IP stack used by that container or
process. This zoom-in functionality is also indicated by the
&#32;<FullscreenIcon className="icon"/> icon inside the badge.

##### IP Addresses

**Hover your mouse over a network interface** <NifBadge nif={veth2Nif}/> to see
a tool tip showing a short description as well as the IP addresses assigned to
this network interface. Additionally, all related network interfaces and their
connecting "wires" will light up.

##### Navigate to Connected Network Interfaces

**Click on a network interface** <NifBadge nif={veth2Nif} button /> to pop up a
navigation menu with a list of related (connected) network interfaces. For
instance, for a "VETH" type network interface there is exactly one related peer
network interface. Hardware network interfaces (which might rather be virtual)
might have multiple related "MACVLAN" type network interfaces.

##### Highlight a Virtual Wire

Hover over a virtual wire for it to become highlighted and all other virtual
wires getting dimmed. Click or tap on a wire to select it: this wire now will
stay highlighted when moving the mouse away. This wire can be deselected by
either clicking or tapping it again, or clicking or tapping somewhere else.

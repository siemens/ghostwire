# <SettingsIcon className="icon"/> Settings

&#x200b;<Brand/>'s [settings](settings) apply to only the domain from which you loaded
the <Brand/> user interface. This allows you to have different settings for
different devices, to tune the display to your specific needs per individual
device.

## Appearance

Choose between the **light** or **dark** theme. In some environments, the **user
preference** choice will pick up the environment preference for either a light
or dark theme. However, not all environments or browsers support this automatic
detection at this time.

## Display Filters Layer 2/3

**Show IP address families** defaults to showing only IPv4 addresses and
routes. Other options are showing both IP6 and IPv4 addresses, as well as only
IPv6 addresses.

**Show network namespaces** (virtual IP stacks) even if they **only contain a
single "lo"** (loopback) network interface, but no other network interface.
Normally, you won't want to see them, as these are network-wise isolated
network namespaces, so this setting defaults to "off".

**Show lo network interfaces** defaults to "off", hiding the loopback network
interfaces in all views.

**Show MAC layer addresses of network interfaces** also defaults to "off", not
showing any MAC layer addresses. Please note that `00:00:00:00:00:00` MACs will
*always be hidden* in order to reduce UI clutter.

## Containee Details

**Show "sandbox" containers** defaults to "off", hiding the so-called "sandbox"
containers that are part of pods. These sandbox containers are automatically
created by a container engine or orchestration system in order to create a
common network namespace shared by all user containers of the same pod. Please
do not confuse sandbox containers with the user's (application developer's)
containers, the sandboxes are automatically managed by the container engine or
orchestration system, but never by users or developers.

**Show namespace identifiers** displays the Linux kernel-level namespace
identifiers for network and PID namespaces. Technically, these namespace
identifiers are inode numbers on the special "nsfs" filesystem. Please note that
&#x200b;<Brand/> follows established Linux kernel practice and thus does *not
show* the nsfs device number(s).

## Detail Sections Default Expansion

Controls when to expand or collapse the individual sections ("containees",
"transport", "routes", and "network interfaces") of a network namespace detail
card, based on the amount of items in a section. It is possible to automatically
collapse huge sections, while keeping small sections expanded for quickly
picking up the information displayed.

For each section, you can choose between:

- always collapsed, in case you don't want to see the details until you expand
  them yourself.
- always expanded, if you're always interested in them, regardless of how large
  that section might get.
- expand only up to a certain limit of items, above that threshold collapse the
  section instead. This is most useful for the transport section, which can get
  quite huge for the initial network namespace in busy hosts.

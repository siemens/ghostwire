# <MenuIcon className="icon"/> Navigation Drawer

## Views

The top section of the **navigation drawer** gives you quick access to the
different views in <Brand/> into the discovered virtual communication inside
container hosts. This drawer is accessible either by clicking or tapping on the
menu &#32;<MenuIcon className="icon"/> symbol in the application bar, or by
swiping from the left side of the <Brand/> application.

<p/>

- &#32;<WiringViewIcon className="icon"/> shows <Brand/>'s trademark [wiring
  view](wiring), graphically depicting how the (virtual) IP stacks are
  interconnected with each other.

- &#32;<OpenHouseIcon className="icon"/> shows the [host's open and forwarding
  ports](lochla). This view basically is a combined and simplified view of the
  host's open/listening ports as well as port forwardings from the host to
  containers (pods, et cetera).

- &#32;<NetnsViewIcon className="icon"/> shows the [detailed communication
  parameters](details) of the (virtual) IP stacks, but without any
  graphical wires.

- &#32;<SettingsIcon className="icon"/> allows [configuring general
  aspects](settings) of the views, such as the IP address families shown.

- &#32;<HelpIcon className="icon"/> this help view.

- &#32;<GhostwireIcon className="icon"/> shows the [copyright and versioning
  information](/about) (for app and discovery engine).

## Wiring/Details Navigation

Only when the <WiringViewIcon className="icon" />&nbsp;wiring and
&#32;<NetnsViewIcon className="icon"/>&nbsp;details views the navigation drawer
will additionally show the list of available pods, containers, and stand-alone
processes â€“ the so-called ["containees"](containees). For instance:

<p/>

<Example style={{ maxWidth: '20em'}}>
  <ContaineeNavigator nolink allnetns={netns} />
</Example>

<p/>

##### Pods ./. Containers

The so-called "pods" group containers with the same virtual IP stack, the
navigation drawer only shows the pods, but not the individual grouped
containers. This reduces clutter. In addition, pods get grouped by their
namespaces into sections, to better visualize their organization.

##### Status Color

The icons signal the type of pod, container, standalone process, et cetera.
Besides, the color of an icon signals the status of a containee, such as
"running" or "paused".

Please note that pods don't have any state though: from the perspective of
&#x200b;<Brand/> a pod only exist when its virtual IP stack has been created, or
that pod doesn't exist at all. Thus, pods show a neutral "pod" color instead.

##### Privileged Docker Containers

To foster better security awareness, <Brand/> shows an <Privileged
className="icon" /> icon next to the name of a Docker container if it is
privileged. Deploying containers as "privileged" should be avoided if possible
and such containers instead be deployed with only the precise capabilities and
security options necessary, instead of the heavy-handed "privileged" setting.

##### Capable Containers

Non-privileged containers can be quite capable from the Linux capabilities they
have been granted. <Brand/> shows an <Capable className="icon" /> icon next to
the name of any container that posseses capabilities not from the [Docker
default
capabilities](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#runtime-privilege-and-linux-capabilities).

# Technical Features

**<Brand/>** supports different container engines (often also sloppily
called "container runtimes").

<p/>

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) ([Moby](https://mobyproject.org/)),
- [containerd](https://containerd.io/),
- optionally [Podman](https://podman.io) (if built with support).

<p/>

There's more to <Brand/>, as it...

<p/>

- can be extended (or might already come packaged) with the "Packetflix" live
  packet capture streaming service for easy remote network captures in remote
  container hosts and container cluster systems.

- discovers the topology of
  [SR-IOV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-root_input/output_virtualization)
  PF and VF network interfaces, even when VFs are placed in containers. SR-IOV
  cards often are used in demanding contexts, such as data centers, not least in
  hyper-convergent infrastructures.

- is [Industrial
  Edge-aware](https://new.siemens.com/global/en/products/automation/topic-areas/industrial-edge.html),
  showing dedicated symbols for Industrial Edge app containers and the
  containerized device runtime. If enabled in [settings](/settings), <Brand/>
  can query an Industrial Edge device for the specific IE App icons and will
  then display these â€“ but please note that this is an _experimental_ function
  with no guarantees.

- is [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)-aware and understands
  the concept of "pods" and Kubernetes "namespaces". And all this *without*
  needing any access to Kubernetes API servers.

- supports putting one container engine *into* another container (engine) or
  running multiple container engines side-by-side.

- understands and explicitly supports [Kind ("Kubernetes IN
  Docker")](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/) for running one or
  more multi-node Kubernetes clusters inside a *single* Docker host.

- works perfectly with [Docker Desktop on
  Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/), where the
  Docker engine itself runs inside a containerd engine, and everything is in a
  PID namespace different from the "distribution" with the Docker Desktop
  integration.

# <NetnsViewIcon className="icon"/> Details View

> &#32;<BookmarkBorderIcon className="icon"/> **Pro Tip:** you can bookmark all
  views in your browser, especially when "zooming in" on a particular container
  or process.

> **Pro Tip:** you can easily create a complete screenshot of the details by
  simply clicking on the screenshot <ScreenshotIcon className="icon"/> button in
  the application bar. This allows downloading the details screenshot in PNG
  image format, in user-selectable image density. Please note that the
  screenshot button <ScreenshotIcon className="icon"/> only appears after the
  details have been discovered successfully for the first time.

The details view shows the discovered (virtual) IP stacks with lots
communication details, but without any graphical wiring. Instead, network
interfaces related to other network interfaces will show these "relatives" next
to them.

<Box m={2}>
  <NetnsDetailCard netns={morbidNetns} />
</Box>

The detail information is grouped into five sections. Each section can be
&#32;<ExpandMore className="icon" /> expanded and &#32;<ExpandLess
className="icon" /> collapsed by clicking on the arrow icon in from of the
section title. Sections can be individually configured in the
[settings](/settings) to be either always collapsed or expanded, or to be
expanded only up to a specific limit of items. The latter is especially useful
for the transport section which can get really huge for the initial IP stack on
a busy Linux host.

##### Section "Containees"

Lists one or more ["containees"](containees) using this (virtual) IP stack,
among other things details about:

- DNS configuration information read from a container's `/etc/hostname` (*as
  opposed to the UTS hostname*), `/etc/hosts` (*name-address mappings*), and
  `/etc/resolv.conf` (*DNS server IP addresses*, *domain name search list*).

- the UTS hostname as returned by the [`gethostname(3)`
  syscall](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/gethostname.2.html).

- for containers: the list of labels (name-value pairs).

- the Linux kernel-level PID and network namespace identifiers, when enabled in
  [settings](/settings) (defaults to "off").

- the "[bounding
  capabilities](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html)"
  limits the capabilities any process in this container can gain at most.
  Capabilities that aren't in Docker's set of container default capabilities are
  highlighted, such as `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` in the example above.

##### Section "Neighborhood Services"

This section appears only when a Docker container is attached to at least one
non-default ("custom") bridge network. Otherwise, this section is hidden.

Docker provides purely host-internal DNS names of services and their containers
that are addressable from at least one of the Docker user-defined networks the
currently shown container is attached to. This section thus depends on which
container is being inspected, and the networks this container is attached to in
particular.

The left column shows the DNS names of a specific service, if defined. Please
note that "stand-alone" containers created outside Docker composer are never
considered to be services and the left column will be blank for them.

The middle column shows the individual container or containers belonging to a
particular service.

The right column finally shows the DNS names for individual containers, either
as part of a service or for a stand-alone container.

##### Section "Port Forwarding"

This section lists the transport-layer ports that are being forwarded, such as
host ports getting forwarded to service containers. Where possible, this list
does not only shows the addresses and ports to which traffic is being forwarded,
but also the containees that are serving this traffic.

Port forwarding information is gathered from these two places:

- netfilter tables (including "legacy" iptables),

- Docker proxy processes that forward traffic in user space,

Please note that Docker containers that are connected to custom Docker networks
(other than the default network) will show two forwarded ports on IP address
`127.0.0.1` and port 53. These belong to Docker's embedded DNS server.

##### Section "Transport"

Shows the active and listening transport-layer communication of the processes
using this particular (virtual) IP stack.

> **Note**: <Brand/> has a truly unique feature in that it makes you clearly
  aware of IPv6 sockets **also handling "mapped" IPv4 traffic** when either
  bound to the *unspecified* `::` IPv6 address or to an IPv4-mapped IPv6 address
  from the `::ffff:0.0.0.0/96` range. In these situations, an **"IPv6"**
  indication will be shown in the "Socket" column. See also [RFC 4291, section
  2.5.5.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4291#section-2.5.5.2) for further
  information on IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses.

> **Note**: a process may have listening and acitive transport-layer
  communication *in more than one* IP stack simultaneously, despite the
  restriction that any process can be attached to only exactly one (virtual) IP
  stack at any point in time. This is possible, as processes can create sockets
  in one network namespace and then switch into a different network namespace. A
  common example are the Docker daemon `dockerd` process automatically opening a
  UDP as well as a TCP endpoint bound to the IPv4 address `127.0.0.11` in
  containers for handling container-local DNS server communication.

##### Section "Routing"

This section show the routing information, such as destination address blocks
and even single addresses. For each route, additionally the outgoing network
interface taken is shown, if any.

##### Section "Network Interfaces"

Network interfaces, including any _related_ network interfaces, such as in case
of VETH peer-to-peer "wires", MACVLAN master-slave relations, et cetera. Network
address information is shown in this section, as opposed to routing information
that is per network stack, and not per network interface.
